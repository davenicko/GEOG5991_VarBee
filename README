This model consists of the following core files:

varbee.py 		   - The classes that the model uses
model.py  		   - The non-graphical interface of the model
model_animation.py - The model featuring an animation of each timestep

In order to run the model you must provide an "Environment" file as a csv file
which should be saved in the current working directory. At it's simplest, the
model can be run by the following command:

WINDOWS
python3 model.py

LINUX
python3 model.py

or

./model.py

if the file is set to be executable and you are in the model directory

The model also takes command line parameters if provided in the correct order:

1) The name of the environment file (e.g. environment.cvs)
2) The number of iterations to run (e.g. 1000)
3) The number of starting bees (e.g. 40)
4) the number of starting mites (e.g. 40)

For example, to use a file called "myfile.csv" with 500 iterations, 40 bees and
10 mites enter:

python3 model.py myfile,csv 500 40 10

Note that the model_animation.py file will also take the same parameters, but
in this instance the number of iterations will dictate how many time steps are
performed between frames, with frames displayed every (number of iterations)
time steps

The model outputs two files:

heatmap.csv
A comma separated value file containing the total number of bees that have ever
been in each of the environment locations.

results.csv
The total number of bees and mites alive at each time step
